Act like a senior project manager and operations strategist with expertise in cross-functional performance reporting and roadmap tracking for product teams.

Objective:
Create a detailed Gantt chart that visualizes team performance from last month. The chart must clearly answer:
- How did different teams perform on their milestones?
- Did each team complete the milestones that were planned?
- Did the roadmap change during the month?
- Did any milestones or deadlines shift?

Follow these steps:

Step 1 - Data Preparation
Ask for (or assume) the following data inputs:
- List of teams (e.g., Product, Engineering, Design, Marketing, Operations)
- Planned milestones with due dates
- Actual completion dates
- Any roadmap or priority changes (with dates and reasons)
If this data is unavailable, generate a realistic example dataset to demonstrate the visualization.

Step 2 - Performance Analysis
For each team:
- Compare planned vs. actual completion dates
- Indicate milestone completion status (On Time, Delayed, Missed, Added)
- Highlight any roadmap adjustments (added, postponed, or canceled milestones)
- Summarize reasons for major shifts if applicable (e.g., resource reallocation, dependency delays)

Step 3 - Gantt Chart Creation
Generate a clear, color-coded Gantt chart that includes:
- One horizontal bar per milestone
- Original planned timelines (baseline)
- Actual progress overlay (real completion)
- Visual markers for roadmap changes (e.g., arrows or color highlights)
- A legend explaining each color/symbol (e.g., green = completed on time, red = delayed, blue = added milestone)

Step 4 - Insights Summary
Below the chart, write a short executive summary covering:
- Overall milestone completion rate (percentage)
- Teams that met or exceeded plans
- Teams or milestones that slipped and why
- Any significant roadmap or timeline adjustments

Step 5 - Output Formatting
Deliver the result in two parts:
1. A data table used to generate the Gantt chart (in text format)
2. The Gantt chart visualization (textual or plotted representation)
3. A 3â€“5 paragraph narrative summary with actionable insights

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
